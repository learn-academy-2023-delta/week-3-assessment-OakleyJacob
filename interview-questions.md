# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX stands for Javascript XML, and it is a combination of Javascript and HTML. Class is a protected word within javascript so we must use className when referring to an html class.

Researched answer: JSX also makes other tags able to self close? Not sure what value that actually provides but thats neat.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer:Yarn is a package manager. I don't believe yarn actually MODIFIES any files. I believe it will add files to the folder you are currently in when running yarn.

Researched answer: After a little googling I think it modifies package.json? But I'd be lying if I said I was sure.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A react component is a self contained snippet of JSX code that usually renders something on a webpage.

Researched answer: React components have two different flavors, class based and function based. Class based have more features according to a light google search but I will have to learn more to say exactly what these extra features are.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer:State values are values that are updated and stored as a user interacts with our webpage. Props is an object that we pass down to child components containing any information (in the form of attributes) that we want to pass.

Researched answer:State is housed and controlled locally on a specific component. Props is read-only and can only be changed if a piece of seed information changes up-stream(like something in state).

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer:The DOM is the Document Object Model. It is a way of thinking about, talking about, and referencing pieces of a webpage.

Researched answer: The DOM is actually a programming interface for web documents. It is used by the webpage to quickly and easily make changes to thwe website.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer:A span tag is more in-line than a div tag. Divs really wrap around and contain an HTML element while a span is more of a tight hug.

Researched answer: While a span is used for in-line grouping of elements, a div tag is used for block-level association.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: A way of developing software that revolves around grouping data and behavior together as objects.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a high-level interpreted language. Which means its commands are far removed from the 1s and 0s read by the computer, and yet the commands are automatically readable by a computer without the need of a seperate compiler.

3. Implicit return:An implicit return is a return that works without being full stated. Such as one liner arrow functions.

4. Ruby blocks: A block in ruby seems to be a collection of statements enclosed in a set of {}. 

5. Ruby hashes: Hashes are like arrays except without a predefined index the users can set their desired keys. Meaning the data held in Hashes is much more dynamic and similar to javascript object key-value pairs.
